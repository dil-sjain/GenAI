Gaps in Manual Test Coverage for Case Management
Access Control & Permissions

No tests for verifying that users with insufficient permissions (e.g., vendors, read-only users) are denied access to add, edit, accept, or reject cases.
No tests for feature flag/ACL-driven UI or API changes (e.g., assoc3p, caseTypeSelection, b3pAccess).
Session and State Handling

No tests for session variable resets, sticky form data, or session timeouts during multi-step case creation/editing.
No coverage for what happens if a user navigates away and returns mid-case creation or editing.
Edge Cases in Case Creation

No tests for creating a case with all optional fields left blank (beyond required fields).
No tests for creating a case with maximum field lengths, special characters, or invalid data types.
No test for the scenario where a user tries to create a case without linking a required Third Party Profile (when 3P is enabled).
Case Editing/Updating

No tests for editing a case after it has moved past certain workflow stages (e.g., after ASSIGNED).
No tests for editing a case and changing the case type to one that requires or does not require subInfo, and the resulting navigation/validation.
Case Stage Transitions

No explicit tests for all possible case stage transitions (e.g., DDQ Invite → Qualification → Budget Requested → Budget Approved → Accepted by Investigator, etc.).
No tests for re-opening a closed case or handling the "open" and "opensync" reject codes.
No tests for the "on hold" status and its unique workflow.
Bulk/Multi-Case Operations

No tests for multi-case assignment (e.g., vendor admin assigning multiple cases at once, as supported in caselist-ws.php).
Advanced Search & Filtering

No tests for advanced search features, including:
Searching by all available fields (e.g., case number, company name, requester, region, etc.).
Using date filters, match case, and "me" filters (requestor, investigator, etc.).
Sorting by all available columns and verifying correct order.
Pagination edge cases (e.g., last page, empty page, page size changes).
API/Backend Error Handling

No tests for backend/API failures (e.g., database errors, invalid tokens, missing session data).
No tests for invalid or expired page tokens (e.g., addcaseAuth, edcaseAuth, rejectCaseAuth).
Attachment Handling

No tests for uploading attachments with edge cases:
Uploading files with unsupported types or corrupted files.
Uploading files with the same name as existing attachments.
Removing or replacing attachments after initial upload.
Handling upload failures due to network or server errors.
Case Linkage and Inheritance

No tests for cases linked to engagements, including data inheritance (Type, Category, Region, Department).
No tests for deleting or unlinking cases that are part of a renewal sequence.
Localization/Internationalization

No tests for language selection, translation display, or bilingual report requests.
Notifications & Emails

No tests for verifying that notification emails are sent at the correct workflow stages (e.g., investigation accepted, report available, etc.).
Billing Unit & Purchase Order Logic

No tests for scenarios where billing unit or PO fields are required, optional, or have special validation (e.g., text required for certain billing units).
Custom Tabs and Fields

No tests for custom tabs or fields in the Case Folder, especially for manually created cases vs. those created from engagements.
Security

No tests for direct URL access to restricted actions (e.g., accessing editcase.php or rejectcase.php with invalid or missing IDs).
Recommendation:
Review and expand the manual test suite to cover these gaps, especially around permissions, edge cases, workflow transitions, error handling, and advanced search/filtering. This will ensure more robust coverage and reduce the risk of critical defects escaping to production.
